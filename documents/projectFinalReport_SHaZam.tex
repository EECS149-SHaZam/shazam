% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference, twocolumn]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The goal of this project is to design a lamp that will redirect its light to follow a user's gaze. The magic lamp will consist of a standard adjustable desk lamp with a microcontroller embedded in its base and servo motors connected to its light source. Additionally, the lamp will utilize a WiiMote to track IR LEDs affixed to the user's face or hat. The WiiMote will communicate relative positioning data to the microcontroller via Bluetooth, which will in turn direct the motors to aim the light source. The controller will behave according to a state-machine that models states such as ``Track'' or ``Stay.'' Figure \ref{fig:conops} shows the logical connections between system components and how they are intended to interact.

\section{Project Components}
\subsection{Design changes}
Although the overall structure and linkages of our system diagram have not changed since the beginning of our project, virtually every block was modified by the end of development.

\subsubsection{Gimbal}
Our original design called for traditional servo motors to drive the gimbal's motion, but we decided to change to advanced, serially-controlled servos. These Dynamixel RX-24F motors (see Figure \ref{fig:hw_mk0}) provided several advantages, the primary one being ease of control.

Unlike traditional servo motors which are commanded to set their position using PWM, our smart servos could be commanded via RS-485 serial link. This provides more timing flexibility in our control logic, since this makes PWM interrupt routines unnecessary. The smart servos also allowed us to set the speed of the movements over the serial link, offloading logic from our main control loop to the motors.

Also, the new servos were daisy-chainable, an impossibility with PWM. This allowed us to use a single serial output, as opposed to multiple, independent PWM outputs, each with their own interrupt routines. This resulted in a subtantial time savings in development, and greater reliability.

A disadvantage was that RS-485 is quite different from serial UART, in that it uses 200 mV differential signaling over two wires and is half-duplex, whereas our TTL UART operates at 3.3V and is full-duplex. We used a breakout board for the SP3485, which accomplishes both level conversion and protocol translation, with the aid of an RTS signal from our system controller.

\subsubsection{Bluetooth}
Originally, we were going to use a BlueSMiRF Gold to connect to the WiiMote. However, the Gold only connects via serial data endpoints, while the WiiMote requires an HID interface. So, the BlueSMiRF Gold did not work.

To resolve this problem, we purchased a BlueSMiRF HID, which has the same hardware as the BlueSMiRF Gold, but has different factory-flashed firmware for HID capabilities. This also did not work, because the BlueSMiRF HID was designed to operate as an HID slave device, such as a mouse, keyboard or joystick; it could not operate as an HID host, to control such HID devices.

In the end, we used a USB-Bluetooth dongle.

\subsubsection{System controller}
Although we originally intended to use the ARM mbed FRDM-KL25Z Freedom board, we decided to change platforms to the Raspberry Pi model B.

We did not use the Pi initially because the lab already provided each of our group members with a free, personal ARM mbed processor. This allowed us to work independently, parallelizing development. In comparison, the Pi cost \$35. Also, PWM control requires Linux kernel programming on the Pi, or a separate daughterboard with its own microprocessor, such as the Arduino-compatible Pi Alamode (another \$35). We deemed this too complex and expensive.

However, circumstances changed later in the development. By switching to the serial servos, we eliminated the need for kernel development or a daughterboard. Just like with the ARM mbed, we could now control all the hardware with a single system controller. Also, when we exchanged the BlueSMiRF for the Bluetooth dongle, the easily-installed support for the dongle in Linux gave the Pi a clear advantage over the ARM mbed, which in contrast required compiling and integrating C++ code. The Pi was simpler.

The Pi also offered new capabilities not available on ARM mbed. 

With the Pi, we could change languages from C++ to Python, and we could develop and test directly on the Pi itself. This meant no more waiting for compilation and flashing every time we made a change. It also gave us an interactive Python shell to test out snippets of code prior to integration. 

Next was the ethernet connection on the Pi. Connected to a LAN, multiple members could work simultaneously on the Pi via SSH. Also, with an internet connection, we could use package managers to quickly install and test pre-built third-party modules for new Linux and Python functionality. The internet also gave us tighter integration with GitHub for version tracking and merging our code modifications. The confidence that we could quickly revert our changes allowed rapid progress even as the deadline approached.

\label{fig:hw_mk0}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Software}
We have created Makefiles (tested on Mac) to enable program compilation without internet access, and to allow us to use our own IDEs.
We also have hello world programs for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blinking the mbed's LED
\item Receiving debugging messages over serial-USB
\item Sending and receiving data via serial to the Bluesmirf Gold
\end{itemize}

We also have the capability to communicate with the WiiMote via Bluetooth connection to a laptop, and we have obtained a ``USB2Dynamixel'' adapter which allows interfacing a computer to the Dynamixel motors to prototype motor control software.
In terms of data filtering and motor positional control software, our peripherals already provide a useful suite of functionalities. The WiiMote performs blob tracking and filtering onboard to provide smooth angular position estimates for the IR LEDs (there actually is no mode in which the WiiMote will transmit raw pixel data). Similarly, the Dynamixel motors are smart servos, so the control logic to maintain a position is internal to the servo and we only need to provide the position to be held.

\subsection{Modeling and Algorithms}
We have developed a finite state machine that models the behavior we want for our project, as well as mathematical models detailing our gaze tracking algorithm.
 
For our state machine, we have two main states, ``On'' and ``Off.'' Within the On state, we have two sub state machines, one dedicated to pitch, and one dedicated to yaw, to control the respective servo motors. Inside the pitch and the yaw submachines we have three further substates; ``Calibrate,'' ``Stay,'' and ``Track''. Figure \ref{fig:pitch_state} illustrates the flow between these states within the pitch sub state machine. Within the Calibrate state, we want to standardize our measurements before beginning any tracking. This state will act as an initialization state and will only execute once. Then, depending on the angle of the user's head, we will either move to and remain in the Stay state or advance through to the Track state, which begins moving the servo motor in accordance to the user's head movements. We have designed guards to avoid actuating the motors when the user may not intend for his motion to be tracked by SHaZam. To this end, we set minimum and maximum limits on the change in desired lamp orientation (based on change in user head position) to which the system will respond. Note that these are not instantaneous changes, but the change over a fixed, short period of time (on the order of 0.2 seconds).

We have also derived a mathematical model that will allow us to reconstuct the state of the LED configuration (which reveals where the user is looking) by obtaining angular position measurements from the WiiMote.\footnote{This model is an expansion of work done by Johnny Chung Lee (Google, formerly CMU). See http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/} The data provided are x- and y-angle measurements, corresponding to the estimated angular position of the LEDs in two orthogonal planes. Figure \ref{fig:geometry} shows the geometry of reconstructing the state in one of these measurement planes. Note that the state of the LEDs in a plane has three degrees of freedom (shown in Figure \ref{fig:geometry} as $u$, $v$, and $\psi$), so three angular measurements are needed to unambiguously reconstruct the state. Once the state in the first plane is known, however, the range data ($v$) is known for the second plane as well, so only two angular measurements are needed to reconstruct the state relative to the second plane.

\section{Path Forward}
At this point in the project, we believe that we have all of the basic components to successfully implement our design. With the new BlueSMiRF module in hand,  we will move forward with creating and testing the necessary software to collect data from the WiiMote on the mbed processor. In parallel, we will use the USB2Dynamixel to move forward prototyping motor control from a laptop. Once motor control functionality is established, the SparkFun board should enable the same control from the mbed, serving as a means to convert data from the mbed UART into the RS-458 format required by the Dynamixel motors.

In addition to continuing to develop our electronics interfaces, we will also iterate on the designs of user-facing components. We will look to create a more comfortable but less mutable fixed LED array for the user to wear so that the distances between LEDs can be better characterized. Finally, the motor assembly will be mounted on a lamp-like frame to enable the desired experience for the user.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
